# TV Show DOM Project

## Overview
For this CodeYourFuture project, the objective was to make a web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which shows details of all of the episodes of a TV show.

The episode data was provided to us as an array of objects. The page of episodes is generated using JavaScript (which will read the properties of each episode object). The [TV Show App](https://cyf-maham511-tv.netlify.app/) is live and deployed on Netlify

## Features I'd like to implement
- Have the app dynamically fetch the data from the TV Maze API.
- Add a shows list and search
- Responsive design
- Pagination/infinite scrolling
